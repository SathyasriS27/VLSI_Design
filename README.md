# **VLSI Design**
Repository containing the simulated schematics of logic gates, counters, adders and registers along with corresponding layouts for semiconductor design.

All files have been compiled and tested using `DSCH2.exe` (for schematics) and `Microwind2.exe` (for semiconductor layout design).

## **Designed Schematics and Layouts:**

1. AND, OR and NOT Gates (Inverter)
2. Function Design with XOR and XNOR
3. Half, Full and Ripple-Carry Adders
4. D Flip-Flop and Latch
5. JK Flip-Flop and Latch
6. Dynamic and Domino Logic for AND and OR Gates
